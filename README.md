## About Me

I’m Vaishnav—a passionate full‑stack developer who loves turning complex ideas into polished, user‑friendly web apps. Over the last three years I’ve:

- **Led development** of a Customer Risk Management System at Quadwave Consulting, serving real‑time risk insights to enterprise clients  
- **Built** a Building Management System using .NET, Angular and Azure Blob Storage, optimizing data flows for smarter facilities  
- **Freelanced** as a MERN Stack Developer, delivering bespoke Node.js + React applications for small businesses  
- Graduated with a B.Tech in Electronics & Communication (CGPA 8.5) and continually sharpen my skills with side projects

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me smashing shuttlecocks on the badminton court, diving into a new novel, or curating a playlist that fuels my next big idea.
