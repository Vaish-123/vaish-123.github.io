## About Me

I’m Vaishnav—a passionate problem‑solver who loves turning big ideas into beautifully crafted web experiences. Over the past 3 years I’ve:

- **Led** the development of a real‑time Customer Risk Management platform used by 1,000+ daily enterprise users  
- **Architected** and deployed a smart Building Management System on Azure that cut manual monitoring by 40%  
- **Freelanced** on MERN‑stack projects, delivering custom apps that helped small businesses grow their online presence  
- **Won** “Best UX” at the 2022 Campus Hackathon, leading a team of four to build an award‑winning prototype  

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me smashing shuttlecocks on the badminton court, lost in a fantasy novel, or curating the perfect playlist to fuel my next big idea.
